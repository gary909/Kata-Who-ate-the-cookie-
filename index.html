    <p>
        For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. <br>
        If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float <br>
        or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" <br>
        ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? <br>
        It was (name)!"<br>
        <br>
        Ex: Input = "hi" --> Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach! (The <br>
        reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)<br>
        <br>
        Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.<br>
        <br>
        Please leave feedback for this kata. Cheers!<br>
